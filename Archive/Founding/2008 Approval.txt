Dear Josh and Robert,

Congratulations!

The ACM Publications Board has approved your proposal to convert
JERIC into the ACM Transactions on Computing Education.  We are
grateful for all of the thoughtful work that you have put into
this effort thus far. Please work with Mark Mandelbaum and Jono
Hardjowirogo to develop plans for the phaseout of JERIC and the
rollout of TOCE.  Free free to contact Holly and me if there is
anything further you feel you need from the Pubs Board.

Best wishes,

Ron
