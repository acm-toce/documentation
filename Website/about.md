ACM Transactions on Computing Education (TOCE) publishes high quality, peer-reviewed research articles on the teaching and learning of computing. TOCE articles are of potential interest computing education researchers, computing educators, instructional designers, teacher educators, school administrators, policy makers, and other stakeholders.

The topics covered by TOCE span all aspects of learning about computing, including:

* Any age, from young children to the elderly;
* Any learning or teaching context, including primary, secondary, post-secondary, professional, and informal learning;
* Any topic of computing, including not only historical foundations of computer science, but also computing and society, computer engineering, software engineering, information systems, information technology, informatics, data science, and integrations between computing and other disciplines;
* Any aspect of computing education, including teaching, learning, literacy, identity, culture, community, policy, diversity, equity, inclusion, justice, reform, and advocacy;
* Any type of research contribution that advances learning and teaching about computing, including, but not limited to novel emprical studies, theories, arguments, research methods, educational technologies, teaching methods, curricula, and policies;
* Any epistemology, including positivist, post-positivist, interpretivist and beyond;
* Any method including quantitative methods, qualitative methods, design methods, and argumentation.

While the scope of TOCE is broad, there are some things the journal does _not_ publish:

* The journal considers experience reports, but only if they are clearly situated in prior research, pose research questions, and use research methods to answer them.
* The journal considers manuscripts on educational technologies, but only if they are specifically applied to learning of about computing.
* The journal considers manuscripts that investigate learning with computers, but only if the learning is about computing.

If you're unsure whether your submission fits the scope above, the editor is happy to provide guidance.
