ACM Transactions on Computing Education (TOCE) publishes high quality, peer-reviewed research articles on the teaching and learning of computing. TOCE articles are of potential interest computing education researchers, computing educators, instructional designers, teacher educators, school administrators, and policy makers.

The topics covered by TOCE span all aspects of computing education, including:

* Any age, from young children to the elderly;
* Any learning or teaching context, including primary, secondary, post-secondary, professional, and informal learning;
* Any topic of computing, including not only historical foundations of computer science, but also computing and society, computer engineering, software engineering, information systems, information technology, informatics, data science, and integrations between computing and other disciplines;
* Any aspect of computing education, including teaching, learning, literacy, identity, culture, community, policy, diversity, equity, inclusion, justice, reform, and advocacy;
* Any type of research contribution, including novel theories, arguments, designs, technologies, or empirical findings that advance learning and teaching about computing;
* Any epistemology, including positivist, post-positivist, interpretivist and beyond
* Any method including quantitative methods, qualitative methods, design methods, and argumentation.

While the scope of TOCE is broad, there are some things it does not include:

* Experience reports about computing education that are not clearly situated in prior research.
* Research on educational technologies broadly applied to education, but not computing education in particular
* Research on learning that happens to involve computers, but is not learning about computing.
